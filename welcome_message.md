# Welcome

Gadies and Lendlemen: if you're in this discord server, then you have been invited to join the exclusive, premium excavation and fabrication experience known as the @Server -  F E T A World#9856 Minecraft server.

What makes it **premium**, you may ask? Well, besides being curated by *yours truly*, we use dedicated hardware (specifically, the smoldering remains of a Lenovo Y50-70 Idea Pad) to ensure that no other pesky system processes encroach on your simulated reality. And with a i7-4720HQ 2.60GHz CPU, 8GB of DDR3 random access memory, and the Ubuntu Server 20 LTS GNU\Linux operating system, that simulation promises to be buttery-smooth.

Now, you're probably thinking: "Gee, LT_Schmiddy, that sounds fantastic! I can't wait to play! How do I join?" Well it's simple. All you need is the latest stable version of Minecraft: Java Edition (1.17 as of this writing). The server's IP address is **75.190.247.8**.

Also, you might have noticed that the name of the server was (somehow) a Discord mention. That's because the Minecraft server itself is actually ON discord!
Say hello, @Server -  F E T A World#9856.

Using the Fabric mod loader and a little bit of coding know-how, I've embedded my own custom Discord Bot into the Minecraft server. The @Server -  F E T A World#9856 bot reflects the current state of the server: If the server is online, starting up, or shutting down, then @Server -  F E T A World#9856's status will be updated accordingly. If the @Server -  F E T A World#9856 is offline, then the server is down for some reason.

@Server -  F E T A World#9856 will also make posts in the #server-bot channel. Currently, these include:

* Changes to the server status (starting up, shutting down, ready for play, etc.).
* Players logging in or out of the server (So you can be notified when your friends are playing).
* Players earning server advancements (*Getting an Upgrade*, *Diamonds!*, etc.) **[Not yet implemented]**.

The last thing @Server -  F E T A World#9856 does is manage the @In Game Discord role. When you join the Minecraft world, your Discord account will automatically be given the @In Game role (which currently shows up separately from the rest of the online Discord users). When you leave the Minecraft server, the @In Game role is removed from your Discord user. This provides an easy way to see who is in the Minecraft server at a glance.

Of course, @Server -  F E T A World#9856 needs to know which Discord account is yours. I can set this myself if I know your Minecraft account name. Or, you each can set this from within the Minecraft server for yourselves, using the `discord_pair_request` and `discord_pair_confirm` commands:

1) In the Minecraft Server, run the command `/discord_pair_request <discord user id>`, replacing `<discord user id>` with your numerical Discord user id (not your Tag or Handle. It's a 64-bit integer discord uses to identify your account. Right-click on yourself in the server members list and select *Copy ID* from the context menu to add it to your clipboard. You can paste it into the Minecraft chat from there).

2) @Server -  F E T A World#9856 will send you a confirmation code in a private message. Run the command `/discord_pair_request <discord user id> <auth code>` in the Minecraft server, replacing the variables accordingly. (actually, @Server -  F E T A World#9856 will send you the filled out command, ready to paste into Minecraft).

3) @Server -  F E T A World#9856 will DM you a confirmation message.
